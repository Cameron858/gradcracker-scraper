# gradcracker-scraper

This is the first projet i've pushed from PyCharm to github, and the first time i've webscraped.

bs4 has been used to obtain key information about mechanical engineering job applications.

I have some long term plans for the project:
  . pulling htmls automatically
  . geocoding loactions and visualising via folium or something
  . then average salary regions within the UK?? 
  . or tracking data over period x, and plotting them. would be cool to see a timelapse of grad eng jobs I guess
